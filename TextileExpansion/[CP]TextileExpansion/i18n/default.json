They are:^  Crimson Red, made from the cochineal beetles that make their home in the desert. You can go forage for them right outside my shop, or you can buy some cactus seeds and hope they come nesting in them - either way sounds like an excuse to visit me!^  Verdant Green, from the sticky sap of strange trees growing from green, star-shaped seeds. They're very rare - I only saw one of those trees years ago, but apparently they've started to sprout over Pelican Town every summer? Lucky you!^  Mystery Blue, from strange blue melons that seems to have human faces on them. Their seeds either seem to simultaneously drop anywhere or not at all, almost as if someone's spreading them on purpose. Freaky.^  Royal Purple, from murex snails that live in the deep ocean. Occasionally a few of them gets snagged in crab pots, so you just have to pray the ocean is feeling generous!^  Pitch Black, from the wood of the Logwood tree which is related to Brazilwood. I don't have a steady supplier for Logwood seeds, but apparently if you keep buying and harvesting Brazilwood trees you may find the occasional Logwood seed in the mix!^Anyway, that was quite the letter and I won't keep you for longer, but if you found it helpful, you're always free to come thank me in person!^   -Sandy",
