# Extra Animal Configuration Framework

[Extra Animal Config](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/25328)
is a Stardew Valley mod that adds extra functionalities to Content Patcher
farm animals recipe definitions.

This document is for modders looking to incorporate this mod into their own
content packs. For users, install the mod as usual from the link above.

## Animal data asset

This mod adds a new asset `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig/AnimalExtensionData`, which
is a dictionary where the key is the animal ID similar to the key of
[Data/FarmAnimals](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Animal_data), and the
value a model with the fields detailed below.

IMPORTANT: This asset will be pre-populated with every animal in game, with
every values set to default. To ensure compatibility with other mods do not add
new entries to the asset (ie. use Content Patcher's `Entries` without
`TargetField`); instead, always use either `Fields`, or `Entries` with
[`TargetField`](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/blob/stable/ContentPatcher/docs/author-guide/action-editdata.md#target-field)
to edit it.

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `MalePercentage`          | `float`            | The percentage of this species that will be male. Currently this only affects Marnie's message after buying the animal.|
| `FeedItemId`              | `string`           | The *qualified* item ID of this animal's food item instead of hay. If set, the animal will need to eat this item in addition to grass and hay if `GrassEatAmount` > 0, or in place of grass and hay if `GrassEatAmount` is 0. If this field is not set and `GrassEatAmount` is 0, then the animal doesn't need to eat.<br> See below for a full guide.|
| `AnimalProduceExtensionData`| `Dictionary<string, AnimalProduceExtensionData>` | A map of *qualified* item IDs corresponding to an (unqualified) entry in `(Deluxe)ProduceItemIds` to its extra settings. This is used to store extra settings associated with an animal produce; see below for more info.|
| `AnimalSpawnList`          | `List<AnimalSpawnData>`   | A list of animal spawn data objects to determine which new animal to add when this animal gets pregnant and gives birth.<br>**NOTE**: The list will be evaluated in order, from top to bottom. Make sure the last entry is always true/has no condition. Also because of this, probability won't work as you initially expect. If you want 3 animals each with the same chance for example, the first one needs a 0.333 probability, the second one needs 0.5, and the third one 1.|
| `OutsideForager`          | `bool` | Whether to make this animal an outside forager: if let outside they can forage from dirt and not consume any grass, though they'd still get a happiness bonus from eating inside a tuft of (blue) grass.<br>NOTES:<br>* If their `GrassEatAmount` is larger than 0, they would eat hay when inside. They still won't consume grass when outside though.<br>* This settings' main purpose is to emulate how chickens work in Harvest Moon.|
| `ExtraProduceSpawnList`          | `List<ExtraProduceSpawnData>`   | A list of extra produce slots to determine which additional produce aside from the primary produce this animal can make.|
| `ExtraHouses`           | `List<string>` | A list of extra houses that can house this animal aside from the primary one defined in its animal data.|
| `IgnoreRain` | `bool` | Whether this animal can go out in rain. You can also override this on a per-building basis (see below).|
| `IgnoreRainCondition` | `string` | A game state query that, if set, will control whether this animal can go outside during rain. The above must be false/unset if this is set.|
| `IgnoreWinter` | `bool` | Whether this animal can go out in winter. You can also override this on a per-building basis (see below).|
| `IgnoreWinterCondition` | `string` | A game state query that, if set, will control whether this animal can go outside during winter. The above must be false/unset if this is set.|
| `GoOutsideCondition` | `string` | A game state query that, if set, will also control whether this animal can go outside. Can be combined with the above fields to make animals that cannot go outside during sunny days, or cannot go outside during certain modded rains/winters.|
| `GlowColor` | `string` | If set to a [color](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Common_data_field_types#Color), this animal will glow with said color like a light source. NOTE: `patch reload`-ing your mod will only update lights when the animal switches location (ie. when it goes out to eat or goes back in).|
| `GlowRadius` | `float` | The radius of the light glow, if color is set above. 10 = 1 tile.|
| `SpeedOverride` | `int` | This animal's speed, instead of the default 2.|
| `TextureOverrides` | `List<AppearanceData>` | What texture overrides to use for this animal instead of their `Texture`, `HarvestedTexture`, or `BabyTexture` field. This is a list of `AppearanceData` objects, where the first matching one will be selected|
| `IsAttackAnimal` | `bool` | Whether this animal will attempt to attack the farmer by chasing them and dealing damage on contact.|
| `AttackDamage` | `int` | The amount of damage dealt (default 1).|
| `AttackIntervalMs` | `int` | The minimum interval between attacks in milliseconds (default 5000 aka 5 seconds).|
| `AttackRange` | `int` | The minimum range chasing range (default 10 tiles).|
| `AttackMaxChaseTimeMs` | `int` | How long to chase before the animal gets bored (default 10000 aka 10 seconds).|
| `AttackCondition` | `string` | A game state query to control whether this animal will attack. Player-based conditions can be used here, and is checked for each victim.|


`AnimalSpawnData` is a model with the following fields:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Id`          | `string`            | The unique Id for this model within the current list.|
| `AnimalId`    | `string`            | The animal to spawn.<br>KNOWN ISSUE: The overnight pop up (X has given birth to a Y) will still show the parent species in Y. This is very hardcoded and difficult to untangle, so don't expect this to be fixed soon unfortunately.|
| `Condition`   | `string`            | A [game state query](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries) determining whether this animal should be spawned. The `Target` location will refer to the animal house that belongs to the animal/incubator being checked.|

`AnimalProduceExtensionData` is a model with the following fields:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `ItemQuery`          | [`GenericSpawnItemData`](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Item_queries)  | The override item query to use to actually generate this produce. Most item query fields will work, aside from quality (which is determined by friendship, unless specified) and stack size (which will always be 1, or 2 for animals that were fed Golden Crackers).|
| `ItemQueries`          | `List<[GenericSpawnItemDataWithCondition](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Item_queries)>` | Similar to the above, but a list of queries with a `Condition` field, where the first eligible entry will be chosen. This list goes from top to bottom, so if you want easy randomness use `RandomItemIds` in the above field instead. Ignored if the above is set.|
| `HarvestTool`        | `string`  | The harvest tool/method to use for this produce instead of its default method. Supports `DropOvernight`, `Milk Pail`, `Shears`, `DigUp` and a new value `Debris`, which makes the produce drop overnight but as a debris item.<br>**IMPORTANT NOTES**:<br>* Debris produce do not grant experience when collected, and may disappear the next day if not collected (manually or with an autograbber). <br>* During testing, if you change an animal produce's harvest method to `DropOvernight` mid-save, any produce lodged inside it will not drop on its own. The mod includes a fallback for this, allowing the produce to be removed by milk pail or shears. Afterwards, it should not happen again.|
| `ProduceTexture`     | `string`  | (DEPRECATED - Use `TextureOverrides` instead) The animal's texture asset to override the default texture if it currently has this produce. |
| `SkinProduceTexture` | `Dictionary<string, string>` | (DEPRECATED - Use `TextureOverrides` instead) Same as the above, but for non-default textures (which is the key, with the asset being the value).|
| `IgnoreAnimalQuality` | `bool` | If set to true, ignore the quality from animal friendship and just use the quality from the item query. |

`ExtraProduceSpawnData` is a model with the following fields:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Id`          | `string`| The ID of this entry. Must be unique.|
| `ProduceItemIds`        | `List<ProduceData>`  | A list of possible produces that can fill this 'slot'. The first eligible item in the list will be picked.|
| `DaysToProduce`          | `int`| How many days until this slot is filled. Defaults to 1, which makes it produce every day. |
| `SyncWithMainProduce`          | `bool`| Whether to only produce in this slot if the animal's scheduled to make its main produce that day. Defaults to false. Set this for produce that is made at the same speed, or 2x/3x slower than the main produce to sync its schedule and reduce confusion.|

`ProduceData` is a model with the following fields:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Id`          | `string`| The ID of this entry. Must be unique.|
| `ItemId`          | `string`| The *unqualified* item ID of the produce item. This field can integrate with the parent animal's `AnimalProduceExtensionData` field.|
| `Condition`          | `string`| If set, the condition for this entry.|
| `MinimumFriendship`          | `int`| If set, the minimum amount of friendship needed before the animal will start making this produce. |

NOTE: To define the secondary produce's harvest method or override it with an item query, set them in `AnimalProduceExtensionData` using their qualified item ID as the key, just like how you'd do it with the primary produce.

`AppearanceData` is a model with the following fields:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Id`          | `string`| The ID of this entry. Must be unique.|
| `Produce`          | `string`| If set, the animal must be carrying this produce. Use an unqualified ID corresponding to the produce in the animal's base data (aka the `currentProduce` field in data mining fields).|
| `Skin`          | `string`| If set, the animal must be having this skin.|
| `Condition`          | `string`| If set, the Game State Query for this entry. Can accept ANIMAL_AGE and ANIMAL_FRIENDSHIP GSQs to limit skins to a certain age/friendship level.|
| `TextureToUse`          | `string`| The texture path to use for this animal. Ignored if `DefaultTextureToUse` is set. |
| `DefaultTextureToUse`          | One of `"Texture"`, `"HarvestedTexture"`, or `"BabyTexture"`| If set, use the equivalent field in vanilla animal data. Will take skins into account.|

#### How `AnimalProduceExtensionData` and `ExtraProduceSpawnData` interact

If you're confused by how these fields interact or how extra produce works in
general, the flow of how animal is decided with Extra Animal Config is below:

1. The animal picks a list of produce it can make in the form of produce
   "slots" - one vanilla slot, and potentially multiple modded slots from EAC.
   Each slot will be in the form of an unqualified item ID.
   * One vanilla slot, decided by taking the `ItemId` field in the
     `(Deluxe)ProduceItemIds` list.
   * Extra modded slots, the count of which is equal to the number of entries
     in its `ExtraProduceSpawnList` field. For example, if this list has 3 entries
     then the animal will get 3 extra slots.
   * For every slot in `ExtraProduceSpawnList`, the mod goes through its
     `ProduceItemIds` list to decide which entry to pick for that slot. One
     item (in the form of the `ItemId` string) will be chosen for each slot.
2. Next, when the animal is harvested (such as dropping on day start, being
   milked/sheared, or digging up), it goes through every slot to determine
   which item it can make. For example, the pig decides it wants to dig, and
   takes `430` from the vanilla slot.
   * EAC then looks at `AnimalProduceExtensionData`, if available, to determine
     whether the item in this slot is set to be have a harvest method override
     which should be used instead of the vanilla harvest method. If the harvest
     method does not match the current context, it is ignored, and another slot
     is chosen.
   * Once an item matching the harvest method is found, it then queries
     `AnimalProduceExtensionData` to see whether it should be replaced with
     another item using the built in item query feature. Using the example at
     the bottom of the page, the truffle is replaced with a diamond, causing
     the pig to dig up the diamond.
   * Once said slot is exhausted (for digging, this randomly happens after
     every dig averaging to 3), the animal takes another slot the next time it
     is harvested. This repeats until the animal runs out of slots.

### Setting up animals that eat alternate feed

1. Optional: In base animal data, set `GrassEatAmount` to `0` so the animal
   doesn't eat grass and hay. And/or set `OutsideForager` to `true` if you want the
   animal to forage in dirt when outside.
2. In the mod asset, set `FeedItemId` as specified above.
3. In the map for the building that will house this animal, add custom feeding
   trough tiles in the `Back` layer with the
   `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig.CustomTrough` property set to the qualified item ID
   of the feed item to be placeable/autoplaceable with an autofeeder (compared to
   vanilla hay trough which has the `Trough` property).
4. To add silo/hopper functionality for your new feed, add the
   following [custom
   actions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Maps#Custom_Actions) to your
   desired tiles on the building exterior or interior (replace `(O)ItemId1` with
   the actual qualified ID of your item):
   * `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig.CustomFeedSilo (O)ItemId1`: Put the currently
     held feed into storage, or show the current feed capacity. The item ID is
     *optional*; if not set it will accept all feed item that can be stored in
     the building (including vanilla hay).
   * If you're adding modded feed capacity to the vanilla silo (see below),
     make sure to also convert its default building action to using this action
   * `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig.CustomFeedHopper (O)ItemId1`: Put into, or take
     the specified feed out of storage. Usable only inside an animal building.
     As of 1.3.0 this tile action is optional - the default hay hopper will
     also work with modded feed.\
   Then, set the following field on your building's `CustomFields` map to
   specify the feed capacity provided by this building:
   * key : `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig.SiloCapacity.(O)ItemId1`
   * value: an integer (as a string). For example, `"100"` for 100 items.

Important notes/current limitations:
* Autofeeder will draw from silos in every location, but the feed hopper will
  only draw from the current location. This is actually how vanilla hay
  works, but doesn't come into play unless modded farm locations are used.
* Animal that can also eat grass will still prefer fresh grass, and won't get
  full happiness from eating their modded feed. If they are not a grass eater,
  they will get full happiness from their modded feed.

### Extra drops from scything grass

You can define extra drops from scything grass by writing to the
asset `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig/GrassDropExtensionData`, which is a map of
*qualified* item IDs to a model that has the following fields:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `BaseChance` | `float` | The base chance to yield this item when scything a tuft of grass. If there are silos to add this item to, it will automatically be added. For reference, hay's drop chance is 0.5.<br>Similar to hay, this is multiplied by 1.5 if using the Golden Scythe, and 2 if using the Iridium Scythe. During winter, this is multiplied by 0.33. |
| `EnterInventoryIfSilosFull` | `bool` | If there are no silos to add this item to, whether to try adding to the farmer inventory. If you want this for hay, there are mods on Nexus for that functionality. |

NOTE: This is compatible with [Scythe Tool Enchantments](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/26217)!

## Multiple possible animals from one egg

You can define multiple possible hatches from an egg with the asset
`selph.ExtraAnimalConfig/EggExtensionData`, which is a map of qualified
item IDs to a model that currently only has the following field:

| Field Name                         | Type             | Description              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `AnimalSpawnList` | `List<AnimalSpawnData>`  | A list of animal spawn data to use instead, which will be evaluated in order. See above for details on the `AnimalSpawnData` field.<br>**NOTE**:<br>* The list will be evaluated in order, from top to bottom. Make sure the last entry is always true/has no condition. Also because of this, probability won't work as you initially expect. If you want 3 animals each with the same chance for example, the first one needs a 0.333 probability, the second one needs 0.5, and the third one 1.<br>* You still need to set this egg item as the valid hatch item for at least one animal.<br>* Any conditions will be evaluated when the animal becomes ready for hatching, not when the egg is placed into the incubator. This is only really relevant for time-based conditions.|

## Game state queries

| GSQ                          |  Description              |
| ---------------------------  | ------------------------ |
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig_ANIMAL_HOUSE_COUNT <location> <animal type> <min friendship> [min count] [max count]` | Whether the specified [location](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries#Target_location) (in practice only `Here` or `Target` works reliably) is an animal house and is the home of the specified animal type (or any animal if set to `ANY`) with a count between min (0 if not specified) and max (no limit if not specified), with friendship above the specified amount (or 0 if not specified). IMPORTANT NOTE: If the animal ID has spaces, wrap it in escaped quotes.|
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig_ANIMAL_LOCATION_COUNT <location> <animal type> <min friendship> [player] [tile radius] [min count] [max count]` | Whether the specified [location](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries#Target_location) currently has animals of the specified animal type (or any animal if set to `ANY`) with a count between min (0 if not specified) and max (no limit if not specified), with friendship above the specified amount (or 0 if not specified), optionally is within a certain tile radius of the target [farmer](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Game_state_queries#Target_player).|
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig_ANIMAL_COUNT <animal type> <min friendship> [min count] [max count]` | Whether the farmer owns a certain count of an animal (or `ANY`), optionally above a certain friendship amount. This is essentially a global version of the above GSQ; see its entry for more info.|
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig_ANIMAL_AGE <min age> [max age]` | Whether the target animal's age (in days) is between the min value and max value (default unlimited). IMPORTANT NOTE: This only works in certain locations, namely animal produce condition or `AppearanceData` fields, specifically ones that pass a golden animal cracker to the input item field (see below).|
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig_ANIMAL_FRIENDSHIP <min age> [max age]` | Whether the target animal's friendship points is between the min value and max value (default unlimited). IMPORTANT NOTE: See above.|

Additionally, this mod enhances the `Condition` field in the animal data's
`(Deluxe)ProduceItemIds` field by passing a golden animal cracker item into the
`Input` argument if the animal has consumed a golden animal cracker, or a weeds
item if not. This allows specifying produce that the animal will only make if
it has been fed a golden animal cracker. This also works for the condition in
the `ProduceData` object above.

## Building CustomFields

You can set the following fields on a building data's `CustomFields` field:

| Field Name                          |  Description              |
| ---------------------------  | ------------------------ |
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig.BuildingFeedOverrideId` | If set to a qualified item ID, the building's hay troughs/hoppers will be modified to accept that item instead of hay, and any animals living inside that building that usually eat hay will instead eat that item.<br>Use this field *only* if you want to override a vanilla building, and building animals, to eat a certain feed type and don't want to add compat to every other animal and animal house interior mods. Otherwise, follow the guide above for custom feed.|
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig.InhabitantsIgnoreRain` | If set to any value, this building type's inhabitants can go out in rainy days.|
| `selph.ExtraAnimalConfig.InhabitantsIgnoreWinter` | If set to any value, this building type's inhabitants can go out in winter.|
