  "CompetitionStarted_spring": "Greetings, @.^We would like to inform you that {{FarmName}} Farm has been entered into the competition for the Stardew Valley Tribune's Farm of the Season - Spring Edition!^ Spring is a time of change and growth, and many farms across the country will be coming out of hibernation to prepare for another productive year ahead of them. The customers will be hungry for fresh produce after the Winter too, so it's a good time to start making lots of money selling fresh foodstuff.^Good luck, farmer!^   -SVT",
  "CompetitionStarted_summer": "Greetings, @.^We would like to inform you that {{FarmName}} Farm has been entered into the competition for the Stardew Valley Tribune's Farm of the Season - Summer Edition!^ There are many fun things to do in Summer, and not just for the children - new crops to grow, new fish to catch, new items to forage; Summer brings with it a host of new opportunities.

At the same time however, experienced farmers can strike it big with some of the most valuable crops found only in Fall; they do take a bit of time to grow though, so make sure you grow them early.^Good luck, farmer!^   -SVT",
  "CompetitionStarted_winter": "Greetings, @.^We would like to inform you that {{FarmName}} Farm has been entered into the competition for the Stardew Valley Tribune's Farm of the Season - Winter Edition!^ Winter is finally here, and unfortunately that does mean crops growing will have to come to a pause. That doesn't mean you can't be productive however; ranching, fishing, and mining can all act as a farm's primary income source; plus, if you have been stockpiling crops now is a perfect time to process them into artisan goods.^Good luck, farmer!^   -SVT",
